    <h1> Automatic User Account Creator (Azure Dev OPS) </h1>
    <h2> The Background </h2>
    <p> I've previously been hired to conduct some work for a MSP (Managed Service Provider), one of biggest delays within the MSP day to day operations was user account creation
        currently the method in which they created and built account was far too slow and inconvenient. For context the client in this case had a hybrid windows environment in which 
        accounts were created on-premis in active directory and then manually imported via exchange on-prem to Office365 via remote move migration.  
    
        After asking around at the MSP I've found that the Azure space was underutilised, and that scripting wasn't a common practice amongst the sysadmins
        (Batch files and basic ps1's were used and deployed via GPO but nothing else). So I started to optimise, I created via some classic Azure Automation.
